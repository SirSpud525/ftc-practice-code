Welcome

This repo contains a bunch of practice functions for FTC code

There is a different class for you to write your code in for each unit

Functions without *** after the number are recommended, those with ***
are extra

There is also a key for each unit. These are just examples, there is always
another way to code something. Do not refer to the keys for help if you get
stuck, ask someone more knowledgeable instead.
